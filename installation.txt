SMF-reCAPTCHA
------------------
This package adds reCAPTCHA v3 functionality to the registration page of the forum.

reCAPTCHA is a free service by Google that protects websites from spam and abuse, by using advanced risk analysis techniques to tell humans and bots apart. 
It works in the background, without user interaction, by returning a score for each request, which represents the likelihood that the latter originated from a bot.

To set up the package navigate to Admin -> Registration -> Settings and set up the newly added section by following the official instructions at https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3.
Keep in mind that it requires at least PHP v5.2.
